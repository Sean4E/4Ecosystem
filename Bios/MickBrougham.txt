Here's what I found on Mick Brougham:

**Dr Michael (Mick) Brougham** was the Regional Director for Enterprise Ireland in the Eastern and Midlands Region, the largest region in their network.

**Academic Background:**
He's a graduate of NUI Galway with a PhD in Biotech and completed 4 years of postdoctoral experience at the University of Florida. His research background is in molecular biology, with 9 publications and 135 citations to his name.

**Career at Enterprise Ireland:**
Having worked in many roles in Enterprise Ireland, Michael has particularly been involved since 2001 in designing entrepreneurial development programmes. This includes the current New Frontiers programme which helps 140 entrepreneurs annually with the development of their investible business plan.

Dr Brougham has also worked in industry, both in an MNC and a start-up.

**Current Focus:**
He's actively involved in regional enterprise development, including projects to develop skills, from costume to animation, in readiness for the planned major film studio in Mullingar. He's noted "a huge issue around skills" in the creative industries and has been working to address workforce development in this space.

Given your work in creative technologies and the Midlands, he'd be a useful connection for Enterprise Ireland supports, especially around the creative and screen industries initiatives he's championing in the region.
